# Rust Ricochet Robot

# Requirements
## Third parties

We use the wrapper of the crate `rust-sdl2` for `sdl2` library. 
You need to install `SDL2 >= 2.0.8`, but note that `SDL2 >= 2.0.5` might also work. 
In addition, you need with `sdl2-image >= 2.0.2`.

### GNU/Linux

Ubuntu example:
```
    sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev>=2.0.8 libsdl2-image-dev>=2.0.5
```

Arch example:
```
    sudo pacman -S sdl2 sdl2-image
```
